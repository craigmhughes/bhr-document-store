# Document Explorer

This is a single page application where a user can view documents/folders; which includes data such as:
- File type
- Name
- Date added

The following features have been implemented:
- Allow a user to open a folder to see itâ€™s contents
- Sort by name
- Filter by filename

## Setup

- If you use `nvm` you can run `nvm use` or ensure you are using node version `v18.20.4`.
- Run `yarn`
- To run tests `yarn run test`
- To run the app `yarn run dev`

## Features incomplete
While aiming to stick to a time limit, the sort by feature has been left without the following filters:
- Date
- Size

Both filters would use the same `filteredData` object callback to apply the sorting to the data. However, the definition of what constitutes "size" should be worked out beforehand.

We can assume that "size" would refer to:
- A new value assigned in the test data object (eg. "200KB")
- The number of files in a folder which would order all folders to the top of the list leaving files at the bottom.

Once a defintion has been chosen, either would be suitable to be checked within the `filteredData` callback.

Tests for these changes to the callback may include separate objects with the same format as the data object:
- Date should use the "added" value cast to a Date object for sorting
- Size should either extract the number of the file size or order by length of each folder.
